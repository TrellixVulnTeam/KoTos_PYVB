V.2.0.1:
- Minor update, some systems didn't like base64

Version 2.0:
- A complete re-write, all my own code apart from the handful of modules not obfuscated.
- The default.py is now obfuscated due to some morons stealing work without crediting the original author and also removing licenses.
Sorry about that, it goes against everything I believe in but until these idiots are dealt with it will stay this way.
